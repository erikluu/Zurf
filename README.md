# Description:

For surfers of all skill levels who need information about local surf conditions. Zurf is a weather forecasting website that provides the user with up to date surf condition data, as well as projections into the future. Unlike other services, such as stormsurf.com and many mobile applications, our product provides this data for free and allows the user to contribute to reviews of local spots as a part of our community.
